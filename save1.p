VI went saw this movie last night being coaxed few friends mine  I'll admit that I was reluctant see it what I knew Ashton Kutcher he was only able do comedy  I was wrong  Kutcher played the character Jake Fischer very well  Kevin Costner played Ben Randall such professionalism  The sign good movie is that it can toy our emotions  This one did exactly that  The entire theater which was sold out was overcome laughter the first half the movie  were moved tears the second half  While exiting the theater I not only saw many women in tears  many full grown men well  trying desperately not let anyone see them crying  This movie was great  I suggest that you go see it you judge
p1
aVIf you had asked me how the movie was throughout the film  I would have told you it was great  However  I left the theatre feeling unsatisfied  After thinking little it  I believe the problem was the pace the ending  I feel that the majority the movie moved kind slow  then the ending developed very fast  So  I would say the ending left me disappointed   I thought that the characters were well developed  Costner Kutcher both portrayed their roles very well  Yes  Ashton Kutcher can act  Also  the different relationships the characters seemed very real  Furthermore I thought that the different plot lines were well developed  Overall  it was good movie I would recommend seeing it   In conclusion  Good Characters  Great Plot  Poorly Written/Edited Ending  Still  Go See It

aVI've seen this story my kids haven't  Boy troubled past joins military  faces his past  falls in love becomes man  The mentor this time is played perfectly Kevin Costner  An ordinary man common everyday problems who lives extraordinary conviction  save lives  After losing his team he takes teaching position training the next generation heroes  The young troubled recruit is played Kutcher  While his scenes the local love interest are tad stiff don't generate enough heat melt butter  he compliments Costner well  I never really stood Sela Ward the neglected wife felt she should wanted Costner quit  concern his safety opposed her selfish needs  But her presence screen is pleasure  The two unaccredited stars this movie are the Coast Guard the Sea  Both powerful forces which should not be taken granted in real life this movie  The movie has some slow spots could have used the wasted 15 minutes strengthen the character relationships  But it still works  The rescue scenes are intense well filmed edited provide maximum impact  This movie earns the audience applause  And the applause my two sons
p3
aVMy boyfriend I went watch The Guardian At first I didn't want watch it  I loved the movie It was definitely the best movie I have seen in sometime They portrayed the USCG very well  it really showed me what they do I think they should really be appreciated more Not only did it teach it was really good movie  The movie shows what the really do how hard the job is I think being USCG would be challenging very scary  It was great movie all around  I would suggest this movie anyone see The ending broke my heart I know why he did it  The storyline was great I give it 2 thumbs  I cried it was very emotional  I would give it 20 if I could
p4
aVMy yardstick measuring movie's watchability is if I get squirmy  If I start shifting positions noticing my butt is sore  the film is too long  This movie did not even come close being boring  Predictable in some parts sure  never boring   All the other military branches have had love notes written them seen their recruitment levels go  why not the Coast Guard too  They are definitely appreciated  the day your boat sinks that is   The movie was very enjoyable fun  Kevin Costner is perfect the aging macho man who doesn't know quit  However  I was most impressed Ashton Kutcher's performance  I have never liked him  never watched any his TV shows always considered him immature  well  punk  In this film  he does great job  He is well his way having leadingman status  I think the film we were shown must have been advance rough cut something  2/3 the way in  the film stock turned very grainy  the sound level dropped microphones were seen dropping all the place  Also the viewing were representatives the movie  looking audience feedback  particularly the parts the film we didn't like   *****POSSIBLE SPOILER  The feedback I gave concerned a couple lines in the beginning  Kevin Costner comes home see his wife  Sela Ward  packing her stuff moving out  He says  Maybe I should be the one move out  And she replies  No  you don't know where anything is in this house  I should be the one go  This doesn't make sense  If she knows the layout well  Costner is right  he *should* be the one leave

aVHow many movies are there that you can think you see movie like this  I can't count them it sure seemed like the movie makers were trying give me hint  I was reminded often other movies  it became big distraction  One the borrowed memorable lines came movie 2003  Day After Tomorrow  One line itself  is not bad this movie borrows much many movies it becomes bad risk   BUT  See The Movie  Despite its downfalls there is enough make it interesting maybe make it appear clever  While borrowing much other movies it never goes overboard  In fact  you'll probably find yourself battening the hatches riding the storm out  Why  Costner Kutcher played their characters very well  I have never been fan Kutcher's I nearly gave him in The Guardian  he surfaced in good fashion  Costner carries the movie swimmingly the best Costner's ability  I don't think Mrs  Robinson had anything do his success   The supporting cast all around played their parts well  I had no problem any them in the end  But some these characters were used too much   From here out I can only nitpick I will save you the wear tear  Enjoy the movie  the parts that work  work well enough keep your head above water  Just don't expect smooth ride   7 10 almost 6
p6
aVThis movie was sadly promoted proved be truly exceptional  Entering the theatre I knew nothing the film except that friend wanted see it   I was caught guard the high quality the film  I couldn't image Ashton Kutcher in serious role  his performance truly exemplified his character  This movie is exceptional deserves our monetary support  unlike many other movies  It does not come lightly me recommend any movie  in this case I highly recommend that everyone see it   This films is Truly Exceptional
p7
aVI only went see this movie I have always liked Kevin Costner  I felt that Ashton did great job in the Butterfly Effect  Unfortunately  even though these two actors were/are capable good if not great acting moments some that was missing here  Some the scenes were just not believable didn't have enough story line support   Though the movie claims influence the hurricane Katrina aftermath  there was very little none that effect in the movie   Overall  I liked the fact that the movie brought forward some what goes into saving lives water perspective   The special effects were pretty good more than little intimidating  Not sure I'll ever go deep sea fishing again  I expected little more emotion in the film than what was presented   Definitely movie that could've been seen DVD
p8
aVI was fortunate enough see this movie prerelease last night  though I wasn't expecting  actually really enjoyed the movie the most part  The rescues sea effects were amazing watch definitely provided edge the seat tense moments  probably all the more knowing that there are guys who do this living  The weaker parts the movie revolve largely around using stereotypical set scenes  I'm not going spoil the movie this really follows along the lines An Officer Gentleman those moments give it little bit cheesy aftertaste   Like I said all this movie is pretty good worth checking out long you can get past the clichés
p9
aVOur family the entire sold out sneak preview audience enjoyed The Guardian  Kevin Costner Ashton Kutcher gave convincing performances the fictional helicopter rescue swimmer characters Ben Jake  After seeing this movie  you can't help imagine how difficult it must be graduate the USCG helicopter rescue swimmer school one day take part in real rescues   Even though this is fictional movie  it delivered rather convincing virtues team spirit  dedication bravery exhibited all the members the actual U  S  Coast Guard   The special effects used create the rescue scenes were incredible  You actually felt like you were taking part in real rescue   I feel the movie could have been made the Hollywood bar scene you see the movie  you might agree the real Coast Guard does not condone such behavior    Very entertaining  very action packed  definitely worth seeing  Thank you  U  S  Coast Guard the REAL helicopter rescue swimmers  So Others May Live  I'd highly recommend this movie everyone
p10
aVI'm Petty Officer 1st Class E6 have been in the USCG 6 years feel that this movie strongly represents the Coast Guard  There were only few scenes that were far fetched  The most farfetched was PO Fischer Kutcher went inside the sinking vessel pull the vessel's captain  the engine room that would never happen  Swimmers are not allowed go inside any vessel no matter the circumstances  Second  the Command Center supposedly in Kodiak  it looked more like NASA command center we don't have any gear that hitech  Third  the Captain the Airstation would not be running the search & rescue cases like 10 people watch  In reality it would be E6 E7 the SAR Controller maybe 2 other support personnel like assist SAR Controller & Radio Watchstander  Otherwise the movie was dead  I think they should have incorporated more the other rates in the CG their roles in search & rescue instead just Aviation based rates  Some the scenes A school reminded me my days their the dumb stuff I did got in trouble in my younger days
p11
aVOnce again Mr  Costner has dragged out movie far longer than necessary  Aside the terrific sea rescue sequences  which there are very few I just did not care any the characters  Most us have ghosts in the closet  Costner's character are realized early  then forgotten much later  which time I did not care  The character we should really care is very cocky  overconfident Ashton Kutcher  The problem is he comes kid who thinks he's better than anyone else around him shows no signs cluttered closet  His only obstacle appears be winning Costner  Finally we are well past the half way point this stinker  Costner tells us all Kutcher's ghosts  We are told why Kutcher is driven be the best no prior inkling foreshadowing  No magic here  it was all I could do keep turning it hour in

aVYears ago  DARLING LILI played TV  it was always the pan scan version  which I hated decided wait see the film in its proper widescreen format  So I saw inexpensive DVD this Julie Andrews/Blake Edwards opus  I decided purchase watch it once all   Boy  what terrible film  It's bad many levels that I really do not know where start in describing where it goes horribly wrong  Looking it now  it's obvious any fans movies that Blake Edwards created this star vehicle his wife simply many other directors had struck gold Andrews in musicals MARY POPPINS  SOUND OF MUSIC  THOROUGHLY MODERN MILLIE  etc also Andrews was snubbed starring in projects made famous stage Julie herself CAMELOT  MY FAIR LADY  etc Hollywood thought she wasn't sexy glamorous enough  So Blake created this stillborn effort  showcase his wife in bizarre concoction spy story/war movie/romance/slapstick comedy/musical  DARLING LILI suffers multiple personalities  never knowing who what it is  Some specific scenes are good effective whole  it just doesn't work all point it being very embarrassing   Mind you  the version the DVD is the director's cut  in this case  let's salvage whatever we can this notorious box office flop  In releasing the DVD  Edwards cut 19 scenes 19         the original bloated theatrical version into this more streamlined yet remarkably ineffective version  The film moves along no idea what it is  We are 25 minutes into it we still don't know what's going why we're watching what's going  What kind spy is Lili  How powerful is she  Was she ever responsible someone's death  Instead we watch thoroughly bored looking Rock Hudson trying woo thoroughly bored looking Julie Andrews  Things aren't helped much the inexplicable reason why the two fall in love  Why does Julie fall Hudson  Why him not other men she got involved  There should have been one her ex hanging around  trying win her back trying decipher her secret  This would have given us some much needed contrast the muddled action  It would also have given us some impetuous the sluggish proceedings  There's no catalyst in this story   One only has look the cut scenes clearly see that Edwards the writer just came ideas inspired Andrews' Edwards' previous successes  The best worst example is the scene Andrews Hudson follows group children who sing in the middle forest  Edwards channeling SOUND OF MUSIC  It's no wonder he removed it the DVD  Back in 1970  that scene might have worked certain level today  that moment reeks desperation  There are other plot elements directly inspired Andrews/Edwards other films  The endless scenes dogfights is inspired the much better MODERN MILLIE  The musical moment I'll give you three guesses was created just make fun Julie's MARY POPPINS persona  which is turned raunchy Julie doing striptease in the act  The ending  bird's eye view Julie running towards Hudson's plane  is another wink SOUND OF MUSIC   The whole thing is confusing  Julie plays singer  born German father British mother  who lives in England sings her English songs in Paris  You never know exactly where the story takes place  Some moments are just badly edited  Like Julie her uncle are horseback  They talk talk then Julie suddenly sprints in midsentence  I'm like what happened here   The comedy bits are unfunny cringeworthy  Every scene the French police are pathetic  Where's Peter Sellers you really need him  The action is stupid beyond belief  When Julie her uncle are their way Germany that train  Hudson's squadron shoots rounds bullets the train  almost killing Lili in the process  Brilliant  What's also funny that scene is the two leave the train in the middle the night Hudson his squadron reach the train even though they fly the next morning  That's one slow moving train there    The musical moments  The beginning is the best part the entire film the reason I gave this film 3 stars it's effect is diminished considerably it's repeated the end  Speaking redundant  did we really need see cancan dance  Crepe Suzette stripping scene Julie stripping too  The Girl in no man's land is OK even if it's bleeding obvious  that moment just doesn't make any sense whatsoever Lili sings it group injured soldiers French hospital  making me wonder  how many soldiers there were injured indirectly the result her spying   The whole project is listless energy  The romance is 100% unbelievable  Rock Hudson is way too old tired looking check out the museum scene  Julie looks dazed  like she's Valium  But what really kills this illconceived project is Julie playing German spy  Edwards desperately wanted dispel the Mary Poppins syndrome afflicting his wife believed that playing traitor was good career decision  As much I like Julie  she's no Greta Garbo  who pulled it beautifully in MATA HARI  Funny enough  even if Julie plays German spy  she still comes across cloying cute   How bad is DARLING LILI  Even 37 years its release  Blake Edwards felt he still needed work it its DVD release
p13
aVJulie Andrews satirically prods her own goodytwoshoes image in this overproduced musical comedydrama  if she approaches her role aplomb  she's alone in doing  Blake Edwards' film woman who is both musichall entertainer German spy WWI doesn't know what tone aim  Rock Hudson has the thankless task playing romantic secondfiddle  Musicals had grown  favor 1970  elephantine productions like Star  this film really tarnished Andrews' reputation  leaving lot dead space in her catalogue The Tamarind Seed came along  I've always thought Julie Andrews would've made great villain shady lady  her strong voice could really command attention  she hits some low notes that can either be imposing seductive  Husband/director Edwards seems realize this  neither he nor Julie can work much energy within this scenario  Screenwriter William Peter Blatty isn't good partner Edwards  neither man has his heart in this material  Beatty's script offers Andrews just one fabulous sequencea striptease  *1/2 ****
p14
aVBlake Edwards tried very hard change Julie Andrews image in this film  He tried make her sexy not realizing she already was  I think they were both still bit irked that Julie had not been chosen film her Broadway success Camelot was passed not being sexy enough  Unfortunately  they chose this vehicle try assuage this belief  It gets the point where it is almost funny seeing Rock Hudson  who we all know now was gay  kissing Julie every 2 minutes throughout this movie  It seems now that they were not only trying make you believe that Julie was femme fatale that Rock was straight  Sadly  they have absolutely no chemistry together the unending kissing scenes start grossing one out  The other error they made this picture was not knowing what kind movie they were making  It is almost three separate movies  There is the drama Julie the German spy trying get military secrets Rock  There is air war movie lots footage WWI vintage planes swooping there is the stupid attempts humor that Blake Edwards seems think he has insert in every one his pictures whether it is appropriate not  In this case  it was not  The only truly redeeming qualities in this film are looking the always lovely Dame Julie hearing her sing in that crystal clear belllike soprano  Of course if you love her  you may overlook the weaknesses this film just her  You can always tell yourself  afterward  that it was hell lot better than sitting through STAR
p15
aVThis is pale imitation 'Officer Gentleman ' There is NO chemistry Kutcher the unknown woman who plays his love interest  The dialog is wooden  the situations hackneyed  It's too long the climax is anticlimactic   I love the USCG  its men women are fearless tough  The action scenes are awesome  this movie doesn't do much recruiting  I fear  The script is formulaic  confusing  Kutcher's character is trying redeem himself accident that wasn't his fault  Costner's is raging against the dying the light  why  His 'conflict' his wife is deep mud puddle  I saw this sneak preview free certainly felt I got my money's worth
p16
aVIt seems ever 1982  every two three years we get movie that claims be The Next Officer Gentleman  There has yet be one movie that has lived this claim this movie is no different   We get the usual ripped scenes OAAG I want you DOR  the instructor gives the Richard Gere character his overdose drills in hopes he'll quit  the Gere character comes back the girl  the Gere character realizes the instructor is great  etc  this movie is predictable the sun rising in the East is horribly miscast top  Costner plays his usual wise teacher character  the only character he can play  you really get sense his limited acting abilities here  Kutcher is terrible in the Richard Gere character  just miscast acting skills barely notch above Keanu Reeves   The main problem this OAAG wannabe is the two main characters are amazingly onedimensional  you never care either in the least Kutcher's character finally turns around just like Gere did in OAAG you just go what  The movie leaves no plot point unturned seems never end if say oh wait  we forgot close out the girlfriend story  the what happens he graduates story  the other six plot points in the movie What's more baffling is the great reviews I see here  The general public's opinions never cease amaze me
p17
aVWow  another Kevin Costner hero movie  Postman  Tin Cup  Waterworld  Bodyguard  Wyatt Earp  Robin Hood  even that baseball movie  Seems like he makes movies specifically be the center attention  The characters are almost always the same  the heroics  the flaws  the greatness  the fall  the redemption  Yup  within the 1st 5 minutes the movie  we're all supposed be in awe his character  it builds more more there   And this time the story  story   is just collage different movies  You don't need spoiler  you've seen this movie several times  though it had different titles  You'll know what will happen way it happens  This is like mixing An Officer Gentleman Backdraft  both are easily better movies  Watch Backdraft see how this kind movie should be made  also see how good slightly rated actor  Russell  plays the hero
p18
aVAlas  another Costner movie that was hour too long  Credible performances  the script had no where go was in no hurry get there  First we are offered unrelated string events few which further the story  Will the script center Randall his wife  Randall Fischer  How Fischer Thomas  In the end  no real front story ever develops the characters themselves are artificially propped monologues third parties  The singer explains Randall  Randall explains Fischer  on  Finally  long you don't care anymore  you will learn something the script meetings  Three endings were no doubt proffered no one could make decision  The end result  All three were used  one  another  another  If you can hang in past the 100th yawn  you'll be able pick them out  Despite the transparent attempt gain points dedication the Coast Guard  this one should have washed out the very first day
p19
aVI wish I knew what make movie like this  It seems be divided into two parts  action sequences personal dramas ashore  It follows Ashton Kutsher through survival swimmer school  guided Master Chief Kevin Costner  then Alaska where couple spectacular rescues take place  the last resulting in death   I must say that the scenes the beach struck me stereotypical in many ways that they should be barnacle encrusted  A typical bar room fight Navy guys Coast Guardsmen puddle pirates  The experienced old timer Costner who is  elderly bar tender tells him  married the Coast Guard  The older chief who keeps trying prove himself that he's still nineteen  The neglected ex wife ashore whom Kostner pays farewell visit  The seemingly sadistic demands placed the swimmers the instructors  all in pursuit loftier goal  The gifted young man hobbled troubled past   The problem is that we've seen it all  If it's Kevin Costner here  it's Clint Eastwood John Wayne Lou Gosset Jr  Vigo Mortenson Robert DeNiro elsewhere  And the climactic scene has elements drawn shamelessly The Perfect Storm Dead Calm  None it is fresh none the old stereotyped characters situations are handled any originality   It works best kind documentary what goes in the swimmer's school what could happen afterward even that's little weak we don't get much in the way instruction  It's mostly personal conflict  romance  tension washing out   It's shame the U  S  Coast Guard is rather noble outfit  its official mission being the safety lives property sea  In war time it is transferred the Navy Department serves in combat roles  In World War II  the Coast Guard even managed have Medal Honor winner in its ranks   But  again  we don't learn much that  We don't really learn much anything  The film devolves into succession visual displays not too much else  A disappointment

aVA tough sell  British playwright Ronald Harwood adapts his autobiographical stage drama into loud  bellowing film WWII Shakespearean theatrical troupe saddled aged  blustery  brilliantbutunreliable star the end his tether  The actor's effete assistant works diligently get his master coiffed costumed production King Lear Air Raid   yet both men are losing their grip their unraveling situation  Based the waning years actor Donald Wolfit  whose dresser was Ronald Harwood  this acclaimed production would seem be welcome haven scenerychewing thespians  Unfortunately  Albert Finney this point in his career  not all elderly seems too robust quickthinking play the actor  Finney Oscarnominated director Peter Yates cannot modulate Sir's moods bouts coherency in way that makes sense us  that in one scene he's stopping train the commanding echo his voice  in the next he's curiously falling apart  With such wreck human being in the midst failing health aptitude  one would assume dedicated assistant would go great lengths protect his boss his future  yet servant Tom Courtenay prods badgers goads Finney carry rather than rest  Courtenay  who played this part stage was nominated Oscar alongside Finney Best Actor  is far more attuned his role  eventually his bleating commands confusion achieve the only real feeling in the film  These two  thankfully  do not peck each other's heads  scenarist Harwood is careful not fall into lovehate pattern which could possibly be perceived in the film's first act   juxtaposition servant vs  celebrity  there's nothing much behold in this portrait except the deterioration narcissism  the hint what once was  *1/2 ****

aVBlake Edwards' legendary fiasco  begins seem pointless just 10 minutes  A combination The Eagle Has Landed  Star   Oh  What Lovely War   Edwards' Pink Panther films  Darling Lili never engages the viewer  the aerial sequences  the musical numbers  the romance  the comedy  the espionage are all ho hum  At what point is the viewer supposed give damn  This disaster wavers in tone  never decides what it wants be  apparently thinks it's spoof  it's pathetically grindingly square  Old fashioned in the worst sense  audiences standably stayed away in droves  It's awful  James Garner would have been vast improvement Hudson who is just cardboard  he doesn't connect Andrews vice versa  And both Andrews Hudson don't seem have been let in the joke perform miscalculated earnestness  Blake Edwards' SOB isn't much more than OK  it's the only good that ever came  Darling Lili  The expensive professional look much Darling Lili  only make what it's all lavished even more difficult bear  To quote Paramount chief Robert Evans  24 million dollars worth film no picture
p22
aVI'm not big fan musicals  although this technically might not qualify musical  But I thought I would give it chance I love war movies  It was mediocre best   Hudson seems totally  kilter in this role  It just didn't work me  Julie Andrews probably played her part best she could  I just find it hard buy her conniving  deceptive spy  Sorry  I know that is classic stereotyping my part  But I have say I think this is Julie her most beautiful feminine looking  I always thought her more matronly  then surely that's result her roles in Sound Music Mary Poppins  No doubt they were desperately trying get her  that typecasting in this role  She was quite beguiling in appearance here  I still didn't buy her spy   I couldn't keep my focus through the whole movie found myself tuning in out  having conversations those in my room which I usually never do  I'm always shushing everybody  So that tells you how little it held my attention  Don't waste your time
p23
aVDavid Bryce's comments nearby are exceptionally well written informative almost say everything I feel DARLING LILI  This massive musical is peculiar blown  produced must have caused ruptures Paramount in 1970  It cost 22 million dollars  That is simply irresponsible  DARLING LILI must have been greenlit board meeting that said hey we got that Pink Panther guy that Sound Of Music gal lets get this too handed blank cheque  The result is hybrid GIGI  ZEPPELIN  HALF A SIXPENCE  some MGM 40s song dance numbers style daisies boaters  hopelessly old fashioned be like musical porridge  MATA HARI dramatics  The production is colossal  lush  breathtaking view  the rest  the ridiculous romance  Julie looking befuddled  Hudson already dead  the mistimed comedy  the astoundingly boring songs deaden this spectacular film into being irritating  LILI is like twee 1940s mega musical some vulgar bits spice it  STAR  released the year sadly crashed now is being finally appreciated the excellent film is genuinely is Andrews looks sublime  mature  especially in the last half hourbut LILI is POPPINS DOLLY frilly I believe really killed the mega musical binge the 60s   made Andrews look like Poppins again which I believe was not Edwards intention  Paramount must have collectively fainted they saw this  another  20 million festering in CATCH 22   12 million in ON A CLEAR DAY  25 million in PAINT YOUR WAGON they had financial abyss CLEOPATRA proportions  77 million tied into 4 films very uncertain futures  Maybe they should have asked seer Daisy Gamble ON A CLEAR DAY LILI was very popular immediate first release in Australia ran in 70mm cinemas months it failed once out in the subs the sticks only ever surfaced that one night stands ON A CLEAR DAY Sunday night double  Thank god Paramount had their simple  1million yes  ONE MILLION DOLLAR film LOVE STORY that  4 million dollar gangster pic THE GODFATHER also ready recover all the  77 million in just the next two years just  5m  incredible
